This game authoring environment was created by the following students of Duke University: Andy Nguyen, Ben Hubsch, Jeremy Chen, Kevin Deng, Jenny Chin, Elizabeth Shulman, Brandon Dalla Rosa, Dana Park, Brandon Guo, Harry Wang, and Liam Pulsifer.

# Developer Notes
This utility is divided into four components:

Game authoring environment: program of visual tools for placing, specifying, editing, and combining general game elements together to make a particular game
Game engine: framework of general Java classes to support any kind of game within a specific game genre
Game player: program that loads the game data and uses the game engine to run a particular game
Game data: files, assets, preferences, and code that represent a particular game

# Ownership

As an equal member in this team, I spent my time focusing on the development of the Game Engine.
